# Send transaction

### User experience

To send a transaction, users need to enter the transaction amount and send to a specific userâ€™s public address or QR code. Users can also send a transaction to a public address that's already in their contacts.

### Implementation

As an Android developer, you will need the following code to enable the user to send transactions:

```java
pendingTx = mobileCoinClient.prepareTransaction(
recipient,
amount,
fee);
mobileCoinClient.postTransaction(pendingTx);
```
