# Transaction receipts (for recipient)

### User experience

Similar to checking [transaction statuses](check-transaction-status.md), users can check the status of sent payments by looking up their balance history in their app's _Settings_:

![Locate the balance history in the app's Settings.](../images/balance-history.jpeg) ![Users can check the status of sent transaction statuses in their balance history.](../images/transaction-receipts.jpeg)

### Implementation

As an Android developer, you will need the following code to enable the user to check their recipientsâ€™ transaction statuses:

```java
byte[] receiptBytes = pendingTx
.getReceipt().toByteArray();
/* ------------------------- */
pendingTx = PendingTransaction
.fromReceipt(bytes); client.getTransactionStatus(pending);
```
